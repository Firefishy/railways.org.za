### Model Railways (Hobby)
In South Africa, model railway enthusiasts are particularly fond of the 3.5mm and 7mm scales, equivalent to the global HO/OO and O gauges. They often gather in clubs and associations to exchange ideas and exhibit their intricate layouts, which typically feature iconic elements such as the Blue Train and detailed models of South African Railways locomotives. These miniatures often showcase the diverse South African landscapes, including the rolling hills of the Cape and the expansive Karoo, reflecting the country's rich railway history.

Railway Society of Southern Africa
https://umgenisteamrailway.com/RSSA/AboutRSSA.aspx
The Railway Society of Southern Africa was established in 1960, mainly for the benefit of a small group of steam train photographers living in Johannesburg and Cape Town.  However, over the years the Society has grown tremendously and branches opened in other centres around the country.  At one stage the Railway Society's membership had expanded to almost 1 000 members, about one quarter of whom were resident overseas.
